-Merged ct_branch and vojos_branch. 
-I took out the "../" in the code (the general directory structure that was present inside
ct_branch) because I was having issues with the pages linking together with each other 
correctly. So everything is in one folder in the branch. 
If you want to make it work for a directory structure on your comp just add the right path.
